## Main research question and objectives

**How having specific scientific profiles affect individuals' research careers?**

- Identification of scientific profiles
- Comparisons between profiles and length of scientific careers, productivity, impact, gender... (to be discussed)

## Rationale

1. Construction of predicting models of contributorship based on bibliometric indicators
2. Validation of such models
3. Prediction of contributorship for a set of individuals for their complete publication history
4. Profiling of individuals
5. Comparisons

## Methodological notes

- Steps 1 and 2 use Plos contributorship data (old dataset)
- Steps 3-5 use complete publication history of a selection of authors
- Analysis is done by fields using high level NOWT Classification of seven subject categories (based on paper references): 
    - Medical & Life Sciences 
    - Natural Sciences 
    - Multidisciplinary 
    - Social & Behavioral Sciences 
    - Law, Arts & Humanities 
    - Engineering 
    - Language, Information & Communication

## Variables

- Author position
- Number of authors
- Number of pubs. of an author at the time of the publication
- Academic age at  the time of the publication 
- Document type: Article or review 
- Contribution types as dummy variables
- Number of contribution per author

## Step 1. Bayesian networks

Machine learning technique aiming at identifying relation between variables

- No _a priori_ assumptions on the relation of variables is made.
- The algorithm is run separately for each field
- We use bootstrapping and run the algorithm 50 times per field to maintain only stronger linkes between variables
- The method allows cross-validation and estimation of classification errors

## Some examples: Law, Arts & Humanities

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Nicolas/Documents/R/Unveiling-the-Ecosystem-of-Science/docs/hum_bn.png")
```

## Some examples: Engineering

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Nicolas/Documents/R/Unveiling-the-Ecosystem-of-Science/docs/eng_bn.png")
```

## Cross-validation: Classification errors

## Next steps

1. Create _ideal_ table conditioning bibliometric variables to show the *expected* contribution of authors by field, career, experience and position.

2. Select a set of authors and predict contribution for their complete publication history.

3. Profiling of authors: Archetypal analysis? Clustering techniques?

4. Comparisons between profiles based on (for starters) career length, productivity and impact
